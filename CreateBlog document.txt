Add Text-

On clicking the add textbox button, a main div is dynamically created whose ID gets changed dynamically each time. 
Within the div, a textarea is visible for writing the content. 
Enter the element ID into the hidden field while adding each textbox.

---------------------

Add photos-

A main div with unique ID is created each time when add photos button is clicked. There is a choose file button 
and an upload button visible inside it. After choosing the file, when the upload button is clicked, the uploadpic() function
is called. There is an img tag with an empty src attribute in which the image is later added when the src is appended.

The form ID also needs to be dynamically changed in order to create an unique form each time.

The element ID needs to be appended to the string stored in the hidden field.



UploadPic() function-

In this function, first extract the elements string of elementIDs (added uptill that time) from the hidden field.
We need to send the formdata and the elements string to the server.

Server will save the uploaded using mutler library to blog folder on the disk. Mutler will assign an arbitrary name. 
Server will use the elements string and update the blogmasterfile.

If the elements string is "t1_p1" , then the blog master file will have .. 

******************
t1
p1

*****************

t1 data is still not there with the server. It will come when "Save" button is hit. 

Current server api will also rename the photo file to p1.* 
This filename is returned to the client in form of json data.  
This filename is then used in the client side to create the path in order to access the saved file
and give that path in the empty src attribute so thet the photo is visible to the user. 

Our client side code the remaining part of the upload form 
is hidden.

(will have to make changes for the edit option as the ID of the previous form will vanish each time and will be lost)



----------------------------------------------
Save button-

On click the save button, the order of the string of elementIDs in the hidden field needs to be checked and then the accordingly the
data inside each textbox needs to be sent and saved in a file on the server side. 
 
Eg. if the elements string has t1_p2_t3 ,
then the p2 will have already been saved on the server

So, the data in the textboxes is left to be sent to the server side.
On clicking the save button, this data from all of the before textboxes need to be saved and sent to the server.
